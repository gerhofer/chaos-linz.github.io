                <p>For all those who have always wanted to try a pen & paper role-playing game, the Games & LAN is the perfect
                    chance to do so! One-shots are the perfect opportunity to take part in a small adventure as one of
                    the heroines or heros. The players are guided by a game master, but the course of the adventure
                    will be decided by the players.</p>

                <p> On Staturday, there will be several role playing rounds taking place in different settings. Dungeon
                    and Dragons (Fantasy), Shadow Run (Cyberpunk), Blades in the Dark (Victorian London/Gothic), the choice is up to the player.</p>

                <p>If you would like to lead a roleplaying round at the LAN, then write just send us a mail to lan@linz.coderdojo.net</p>

                    Have you ever wondered how a different reality would feel like? Then you are at the right place! If you ever wanted to 
                    cut stuff in a rythm (Beat Saber), shoot things in bullettime (SUPERHOT) or disarm bombs with friends (Keep talking and nobody explodes),
                    everything is possible with a VR-Set! For that we provide you with a HTC Vive and a Oculus Rift.
